# StableDiffusion
Investigating Mathematical foundations of Diffusion Models and Stable Diffusion in particular

This is a project for Computer Vision course regarding the foundations of diffusion models in general and stable diffusion in particular.
Diffusion model field apparently started in 2015, found its proper place in deep learning in 2020 and bloomed in 2022. In the report, The historical aspect explored shortly followed by main types of diffusion model and their mathematical properties. Namely, DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), SDE (Stochastic Differential Equations), and SGM (Score-based Generative Models). Then, in the method, Stable diffusion is investigated in particular which utilized VAE (variational autoencoders) for image compression and more efficient computing, and cross attention to fuze conditioning data (usually the prompt for the image).
